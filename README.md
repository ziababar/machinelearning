Machine Learning algorithms implementation

Classification
 - Naive Bayes
 - Logistic Regression
    - classifying data in two categories
    - finding the best way to split a dataset
 - Softmax Regression
    - Classifying data into multiple categories
 - Neural Network
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Decision Trees
 - Random Forests
 - Gradient Boosting Machines

Regression
 - Linear Regression
    - predicting trends
    - fitting a curve to data points
    - describing relationships between variables

Clustering
 - K-Means
    - clustering data into a fixed number of categories
    - automatically partitioning data points into separate classes
 - Other clustering algorithms besides k-means

Dimensionality Reduction
 - Principal Component Analysis


 - Hidden Markov Model (Viterbi)
    - revealing hidden causes of observations
    - finding the most likely hidden reason for a series of outcomes

 - Self-organizing map
    - clustering data into arbitary categories
    - visualizing high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional embedding
